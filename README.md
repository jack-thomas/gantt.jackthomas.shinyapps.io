# Gantt Chart Builder via R Shiny

## TODO

In order of priority

- [ ] Allow user to download a template
- [ ] Setup all possible inputs as URL parameters
- [ ] Give user option to change text size
- [ ] Give user option to set image height and width
- [ ] Give user a button that downloads the image
- [ ] Setup rounded rectangles
   - I've sort of started, but it's definitely not working
